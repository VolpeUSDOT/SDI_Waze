## Machine learning approaches in transportation safety <a name = "machine"></a>

**@Abbas:2016 - Modeling the dynamics of driver's dilemma zone perception using agent based modeling techniques**

- In a driving simulation study, used Agent Based Models (ABM) to investigate how drivers impacts of driving in a 'dilemma zone', such as too close to an intersetion to safely stop. Models include the MATsim dyanamic agent-based traffic simulation model. 

**@Bahouth:2012 - Influence of injury risk thresholds on the performance of an algorithm to predict crashes with serious injuries**

- 

**@Chiou:2013a - A two-stage mining framework to explore key risk conditions on one-vehicle crash severity**

- This research combines data mining and a logistic regressino approach to identify crash severity in one-vechicle crashes.

**@Kwon:2015 - Application of classification algorithms for analysis of road safety risk factor dependencies**

- 

**@Srinivasan:2015 - Crash Prediction Method for Freeway Facilities with High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) and High Occupancy Toll (HOT) Lanes**

**@Sun:2016 - Developing Crash Models with Supporting Vector Machine for Urban Transportation Planning**

## Crowdsourced data analysis approaches <a name = "crowd"></a>

**@Vasudevan:2016 - Predicting Traffic Flow Regimes From Simulated Connected Vehicle Messages Using Data Analytics and Machine Learning**

- 

## Spatial regression for road safety <a name = "spatial"></a>

**@Schultz:2015 - Use of Roadway Attributes in Hot Spot Identification and Analysis**
