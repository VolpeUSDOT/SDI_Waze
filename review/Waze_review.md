## Machine learning approaches in transportation safety <a name = "machine"></a>

**@Abbas:2016 Modeling the dynamics of driver's dilemma zone perception using agent based modeling techniques**

- In a driving simulation study, used Agent Based Models (ABM) to investigate how drivers impacts of driving in a 'dilemma zone', such as too close to an intersetion to safely stop. Models include the MATsim dyanamic agent-based traffic simulation model. 

**@Bahouth:2012 Influence of injury risk thresholds on the performance of an algorithm to predict crashes with serious injuries**

- Optimization for first responders, using logistic regression on National Automotive Sampling System / Crashworthiness Data System (NASS/CDS) to determine how variation in injury risk thresholds affects crash predictions. Standard logistic regression approach, where outcomes are binary for each type of crash (separate models, not ordinal).

**@Chiou:2013a A two-stage mining framework to explore key risk conditions on one-vehicle crash severity**

- This research combines data mining and a logistic regressino approach to identify crash severity in one-vechicle crashes. Genetic mining rule (GMR) model developed, to identify 'rules' which correspond to variables most associated with risk of a crash. The variables were then used in a hierarchical logistic regression (mixed logit model) to identify road conditions associated with serious crashes. 
- Similar to proposed SDI Waze project approach, where random forests used to identify combinations of variables highly associated with EDT-level crashes, and then logistic regression used to assign probability of a crash to Waze events and test statistical significance. Use a training/validation approach for the rule-mining, 70% of data for training, 30% for validation.
