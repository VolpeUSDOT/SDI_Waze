## Machine learning approaches in transportation safety <a name = "machine"></a>


**A two-stage mining framework to explore key risk conditions on one-vehicle crash severity**

[@Chiou:2013a]

This research combines data mining and a logistic regressino approach to identify crash severity in one-vechicle crashes.

**Application of classification algorithms for analysis of road safety risk
factor dependencies**

[@Kwon:2015]

**Crash Prediction Method for Freeway Facilities with High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) and High Occupancy Toll (HOT) Lanes**

[@Srinivasan:2015]

**Developing Crash Models with Supporting Vector Machine for Urban Transportation Planning**

[@Sun:2016]

## Crowdsourced data analysis approaches <a name = "crowd"></a>

**Predicting Traffic Flow Regimes From Simulated Connected Vehicle Messages Using Data Analytics and Machine Learning**

[@Vasudevan:2016]
