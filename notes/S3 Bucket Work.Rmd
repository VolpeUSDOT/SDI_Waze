Notes on how to share files with other members of the SDI Waze team:

- From RStudio session, save files to a tempory output location, like "tempout"
- From Jupyter Notebook, run the script `sdc_s3_out.sh` while logged in as `ec2-user`. This is the only user with permissions to write out to the shared S3 buckets.
  + Open a Juptyer Notebook session at https://<username>-workspace.securedatacommons.com:8888/
  + New > Terminal or Running > select an already-running terminal
  + Run the script as follows, with your username in the path:
  
```
sudo /home/daniel/SDI_Waze/utility/sdc_s3_out.sh
```

If this fails, make sure permissions are set up correctly:

```
sudo chmod u+x /home/daniel/SDI_Waze/utility/sdc_s3_out.sh
```

Here is the script to write out some test files:

```{r}
output.loc <- "~/tempout"


# assuming a data.frame 'results' exists
write.csv(results[1:100,], file = file.path(output.loc, "TestResults.csv"), row.names = F)
```
