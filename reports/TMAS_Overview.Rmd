# TMAS data

Three kinds of data relevant to our work here:

 1. Station
 2. Class    - Counts for each station 
 3. Volume

For testing purposes, I exported Ohio, January 2019 data for these three data types, using the export feature on TMAS (https://fhwaapps.fhwa.dot.gov/). For station data, there is no monthly breakdown.
